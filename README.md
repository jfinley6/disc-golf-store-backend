# Phase-5-Project Out of Bounds Discs

A disc golf shop which allows you to browse a selection of discs. After signing up for an account, you will receive one email welcoming you to the site. By having an account, you are able to add discs to a shopping cart and once you are happy with your selection, check out. Clicking the profile icon button will take you to a page where you can see all of your orders. A minute after making the order it will change from "processing" to "ready for pickup" to simulate your order being processed. On the home page there is a spot for "Discs of the Day" which will reset every day at midnight. The footer has a contact form which will send an email on your behalf to the site owner. On the lefthand side of the page you are able to select the types of discs to browse. Each type of disc has a different number and is paginated depending on how many they have. Once you are browsing discs, you can also sort by the different statistics that a disc has. Clicking a disc will take you to it's page where you can learn more about it.
